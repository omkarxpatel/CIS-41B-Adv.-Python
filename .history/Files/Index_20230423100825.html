          Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) 
          is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies 
          beyond the orbit of Neptune.

          Charon is almost half the size of Pluto. The little moon 
          is so big that Pluto and Charon are sometimes referred 
          to as a double dwarf planet system.

          Makemake is a member of a group of objects 
          that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune 
          called the Kuiper Belt.

          Eris is the most massive and second-largest known dwarf 
          lanet in the Solar System. It is a trans-Neptunian object 
          in the scattered disk and has a high-eccentricity orbit.

          Ceres is a dwarf planet in the asteroid belt between the orbits 
          of Mars and Jupiter.
