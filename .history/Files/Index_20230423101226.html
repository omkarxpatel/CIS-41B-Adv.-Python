          Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) 
          is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies 
          beyond the orbit of Neptune.
        </p>

          Charon is almost half the size of Pluto. The little moon 
          is so big that Pluto and Charon are sometimes referred 
          to as a double dwarf planet system.

          Makemake is a member of a group of objects 
          that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune 
          called the Kuiper Belt.

          Eris is the most massive and second-largest known dwarf 
          lanet in the Solar System. It is a trans-Neptunian object 
          in the scattered disk and has a high-eccentricity orbit.

          Ceres is a dwarf planet in the asteroid belt between the orbits 
          of Mars and Jupiter.
